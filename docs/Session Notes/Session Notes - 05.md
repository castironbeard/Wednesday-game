Session 5
In town, burning a day while waiting to shop
Towers are carved in king, queen, Dalgideon, and Thoradin

Decided to spend the day exploring hexes around town
River flows east to west
Hex to the East (on the road) we meet a cart made of light, strange wood, brightly painted, pulled by camels
	2 men driving the cart are wearing hijab
	Trade spices and silks for iron and steel. And drugs.
	Across the river, looking into the forest (the Dreadwood), the Elf can tell there's no keeper/druid to manage things, senses a darkness, an unliving blight of some kind

Hex to the North of that - gets a little more wild in the grasslands.

Hex to the NW of that - sound of rushing water to the north

Hex to the N of that - Waterfall coming from the mountains, into Loch Rannock - Very Bob Ross
	Potential campsite in the center of the lake, maybe 50-60' out
	Standing stone on an island in the middle with a Dwarven symbol on it - shield with a warhammer over a chevron, the symbol of house Broadshield (not one of the noble seven). Gundenthol - guards and mercenaries
	Large animal (deer, bear) tracks and evidence, fish in lake
	Forest to the north seems to have a keeper/druid

There are stairs and an arch at the top of the staircase to the north

Walk due south back to town and arrive as sun sets
