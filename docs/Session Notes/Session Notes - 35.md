**Readying 14 - Freeday**

*Previously
North of Hall of Statues - broad hallway, multiple arches and hallways going E and NW.  Hallway stretches away beyond what we can see - roof is too tall - large important room.  Large statue of Thaneduhr, and others that could be a relative of the current king, defaced. Rubble piles surround. Destroyed statue to the SE.*

*Being thorough with the nooks. Checking SW. Black jelly thing on the rock walls. Explodes when touched with a ration. Always is down, but we heal him. As we do, 5 massive flagstone spiders come from the East.*

Sleep spell knocks out 4, Emmit destroys another.

Exploring along the south wall.  Away to the East, giant statues as columns, 60-70' tall, depicting dwarvish paragons.  Room opens massively to the East, consisting of piles of rubble.
Heading south, statue of Dalgeddin
Statue to the west, crumbled
Statue to the east, defaced Thuredain(?)
Pass several statues moving along to the east, then find double doors connecting to where we've been before. An archway to the south is filled with rat tracks.

H. Badger talks to them (as burrowing animals) - we feed them several sets of rations. Talking to them, they say they have shinies - a pouch under one of the rocks, and we can have it if we leave the babies alone.  They also say there's "hard food, still fighting, in the wall, across from stairs".

Heavy coin purse - 

Down the hall in this room, there are stairs going up. The rats say they are blocked.  Setting up an ambush outside the wall with the "hard food".  Pushing on the door results in an explosion, knocking Bovril and Alec prone.  Dwarven skeletons step out of the door.  Bones bleached white, dwarven runestones set in their skulls.

When they are destroyed, the runestones fall out of their head. 4 total runestones
