**Fireseek 28 - Freeday, morning**  Torrential Rain
Picking through retainers
- Level 0 human
- Bard

The day starts and we can't find Gigglebottoms. He'd been drinking all night in the tavern and we find him in Room #4, passed out, with Dundril Cobblestone (male dwarf) and an adventurer from the party called the [[NPCs#Wolverines]].

Making an offering at the temple
- Michael - Human, White robes, from Threshold, symbol of St Ygg

Arrive at south entrance
- rubble has been pushed aside by great strength
- Pouch when searching rubble - Elvish make - moss agate, orange sunstone, tiger eye agate, smoky quartz

Climb to top of East battlement
Freshly killed (blood is cold) 3-4 goblins
Bloody footprints go to first staircase and then stop
Finely made quiver that matches pouch

Moving down staircase and back up to the next battlement
Dead elf and about 6 dead goblins - fresh kills
Elf has bite marks on the left arm - humanoid size and shape - 4 bites, straight line from shoulder to elbow
Searching bodies finds Dwarvish runestone circular, flat, smooth stone - symbol of 3 leaves on it #runestone 

Rest in arrowslit room
Rats approach while we rest
They ignore us so we go around the corner away from them

Largish room to the north of where we've explored so far
geometric patterns on the wall
dust on the floor but no footprints
wooden door to the North with iron markings
hallway extends to the NE

Opening wooden door is a short hallway and 4 cell like rooms without doors
Rooms appear to be empty
3rd room has a coin bag in the corner with silver coins spilling out of it (5sp)
Dust, no footprints
A bag of bloody cysts falls on Bovril and splashes Ellinia
Zombies arrive at the door while resting
Michael turns them
Checking final room in the 4 cell area - under the rubble there is a key (found with a 10' pole)
Key is dwarven made, 3 dimensional multi-headed, butt is a circle loop
