Session 6
Algar the Absentee Bartender - Roy kept calling him Larry

Went north to the lake - camped on the south side
Standing stone on the island
	Dwarven writing, Shield with a warhammer over a chevron
	I Jorie of House Broadshield stood alone and killed orcs of the red eye clan, slew 21 before being called home to Geddinthor
	Rubbing fingers over stone can tell rock was once 3x this size, the rock has been here 600 years and falls in line with the year the dwarves fled
	Natural stone other than carving
	Does not appear to be high craftsmanship, hastily done, around the base is some kind of bone fragments

Went northeast around the lake, then northwest into Everwinter Forest
Stairs carved into the cliff face - rough, primal, travel to the North then disappear behind the waterfall and continue up - 2-3' wide, steep
	Stairs are wet, cracked with age
	Elves can see that spears are stuck into the rock close to the top, with skulls stuck on the spears

Can see the arches (arched doorway into the mountains) at the top - look to be about the size of the gates of Dalgiddon

Most of party went up to scout while Bovril stayed with the mules
	
Behind the waterfall there's a small dugout
	Strewn across the floor is a massive pile of small animal bones
	Smell of death

Arched entryway - Karir Kalik (Fortress along the Water)
	Looking out from this point is an awe inspiring view of the lake and forest to another mountain chain in the distance
	The doors to the keep are open
	All around the gate are spears with skulls on top, with the ones closer to the stairs having flesh on them still, marked with 2 red ovals
	Clearly Orcs
	Rubble and skeletons inside the archway
	similar to the King's gate, but less well fortified - wider and moves SE to NW

Looking across the forest canopy from here we see the Henge of 9 Stens

Camped on the north side of the lake at the edge of the woods

Next morning - A white dragon flies out of the mountains and over the forest, catches a bear, and flies away into the moutains with it


Going into the mountain through the archway
	Top of the archway appears to be the face of a dwarven king

Numerous rubble piles, especially in the SW and NE corners
	Battlements 20' up on both sides, portcullises north (closed) and south (open), arrow slits on ground level 35' in

Killed two orcs, drunk and sleeping in southern room
Plate mail - holy symbol of St Ygg
Killed two orcs in the cells, captured one
	They have raiding parties
	They come from the deep dark
	They work with the grey skins and uruk hai
Storeroom - 3 crates containing dried meat, 2 small barrels of mead
