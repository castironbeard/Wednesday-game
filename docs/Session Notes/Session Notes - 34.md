**Readying 14 - Freeday**

North of Hall of Statues - broad hallway, multiple arches and hallways going E and NW

East archway - 4 dwarven skeletons, blasted by clerical power

West archway - totally empty

Exploring more to the north, entering a doorway to the east looking for a place to rest

East door: White mold all over the floors, especially to the south, broken barrels litter the room
Touch the mold with a 10' pole, a ripple cascades across it creating a cloud of spores, light it on fire
Use Ignis to light the yellow mold under the door on fire
Empty room
one room in here has a 1'x1' hole in the east wall from a partial collapse

Badger in media res start - running down western hallway pursued by goblins, ducks into our doorway following our light
We bargain with the goblins, buying the gnome for 25gp, and he leaves
A gray ooze drops from the ceiling in the bone/hole room

Going south to an empty room with a door to the east

Exiting east into the large hallway

25' tall Dalgeddin statues holding hammers above their heads form an archway in the eastern wall
All the walls in this hallway are depictions of dwarves doing dwarf things (mining, forging, inspecting gems, etc.). Anything 6' and below is defaced.

Moving through archway, two massive stone doors, tunnelers on the left and construction clans on the right, passing stone back and forth (look like locks, passing across the door) -- none of this is defaced, carving is expert

Carl spots a mechanism at (dwarf) eye height

stoneborn (rulers), ironforge (forge), hammerhand (warriors), tunneltrue (diggers), broadbeams (builders), longbeard (learning and religion), cobblestones (serve and hold up civilization)

"The trilliums bloom along loch rannock to the east, the bald eagle once again nests along the eternal mountains west, and the runestones read the same each way they are cast: seek the forge"

Outer ring - Mountain west, inner ring - mountain east ---- we dumb luck into the solution and the doors open

Hallway stretches away beyond what we can see - roof is too tall - large *important* room.

Large statue of a king, could be a relative of the current king, defaced. Rubble piles surround. Destroyed statue to the SE.

Being thorough with the nooks. Checking SW. Black jelly thing on the rock walls. Explodes when touched with a ration. Always is down, but we heal him. As we do, 5 massive flagstone spiders come from the East.
