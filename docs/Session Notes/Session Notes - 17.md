**Fireseek 20, Earthday, morning**
Starting in Threshold
Always sketch of the spell - interpretation - thinks maybe casting it on a road, picking up dirt and dropping it, will allow them to ask the road questions:  Who traveled on you recently? etc.
Dreams that night of a book on a pedestal which opens and rifles through to a page with a single paragraph
> A finger trails the letters across a dusty tome. 
> A finger points the way down a dark haunted alley. 
> A finger feels for the pulse of life on a long decayed corpse. 
> A finger scratches the floorboards beneath your feet. 
> A finger chewed down to a white bone. 
> A finger that is not there. 
> A finger catches a shed tear and slides it into a bottle.
> These are the [[Lore#Hand of Gaub|Seven Fingers of the Hand of Gaub]].

Pages flip until a seven fingered hand grows out of the book, getting bigger and crushing the building, reaching for the skies.
