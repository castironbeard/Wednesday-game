**Readying 9 - Sunday**

Meeting with the survey team about the blue prints - Tunneltrue and Broadbeam
"Rir Alyr" = New Hope
Present the blueprint - looking like 20k gp, plus protection, plus we need buy-off from the royals and priests

Stopping into the priests' offices to get blessing for our plan
Old One [[NPCs#Hamelet#Khalg Hammerhand|Khalg Hammerhand]] - Suggests we present the case to him, and he'll present it to the other old ones. They cannot meet on this until the next double moon, in one month.  An offering would ease the path - say, a holy relic.

Always uses the Road Spell to find Gigglebottoms.  He went to the SW, to the Free City of Threshold on the back of a cart with some strange hookers and a one-eyed dwarf.

**Readying 10 - Moonday**

Proceed to the Doors with the retainers and light units from the mercenaries
Leaving light horse and light unit with the supplies
Taking two medium units into the dungeon

Straight up the main hall to the Hall of the Heavens
- Massive pillared hall, built to awe visitors
- 10' wide, 100' high pillars line every 20' to hold the ceilings, light streams in from holes in the ceiling
- Statues to the gods in each corner, now defiled
- Would have been filled with guards, merchants, and stalls
- The central light window shines on the doors to the West
- In one of the rubble piles we find a smooth stone, with a holy symbol of Dalgeddin, functions as a "Remove Fear" scroll - Carl takes it
- Exploring to the North and West of the Hall of the Heavens, we find some double doors to the west and spot some rats to the north
- to the SW, a rather large rubble pile that looks like it was a statue at one time AND another door to the South
- Search the rubble pile - find a key with the face of [[Lore#Gods#Thaneduhr]] on the base - Carl takes this

Through the Western double doors, a wide hallway leading to a cross way
To the south, checking with infra, no heat signatures but a strong alkaline smell like this was a latrine in the past
Ellinia lights a rod and sticks it into the room - the ancient methane lights and explodes.  Room was empty otherwise.

Proceeding down hallway.  A waist high small, circular object, colder than the surroundings.  A door is in front of us, ajar.  Remains of wooden furniture, long rotted.  Possibly an officers' quarters?  Dusty, not accessed recently.

Officers' quarters have another room to the SW (archway) - nothing pings on infravision
We find - hand sized rune stone, dwarvish, "Seek the Hammer of the Dwarvish Lords" #hammer #runestone 

Smaller arch room in SW - Old chalk drawing on the wall - looks like a piece of map - in Dwarven it says "Beware"![[Pasted image 20231220223805.png]]

[[Dwarrowdeep, Ruins of Kaer-Kelek#Hall of Pillar Statues]] - Heading west through the wide hall, through large archway - large 10' square pillars, 30' tall - dwarven warriors, all defaced but one (northern pillar, to our right).
- The Northern statue is one of Thaneduhr with glistening red glowing eyes - large rubies?
- Statue to the south might have had gems in the eyes previously but they've been chipped out
- SE connects back to the Western entryway, murder holes, and battlements
- S and N are archways to new areas
