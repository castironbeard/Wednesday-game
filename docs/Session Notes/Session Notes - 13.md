We shop, resupply, and identify the knuckle bones

Knuckle bones - (3 uses left) will tell you what you need to know, same as Cleric spell "augury (Labyrinth Lord)" - will the next action be good or bad, can see as far as 3 turns into the future
	An augury can tell the caster whether a particular action will bring good or bad results in the immediate future. The base chance for receiving a true reply is 70% + 1% per caster level;  this roll is made secretly. The augury can see into the future only 3 turns, so anything that might happen after that does not affect the result. Thus, the result will not take into account the longterm consequences of a contemplated action.
