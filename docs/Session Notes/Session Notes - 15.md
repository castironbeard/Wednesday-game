**Fireseek 17 - Moonday, night**
Torrential rains, camping near East Entrance

*Elves take watch, Always, Karra, Roy
north facing trees and rocks to the south
First watch - a female scream to the north, 2 or 3 orcish war cries.  Always ignores it and 10 minutes later he hears sticks breaking coming towards us. All wake up, help Emmit into his armor.
A female elf runs past, bloodied from a wound in her shoulder, west to east, top torn, bottoms white furs, decorated with bones, platinum white hair.  She turns to catch her breath and two arrows slam into the tree next to her.  She gasps out "Orcs, six, rats"*

We'll open with surprise next week.

6 orcs and 6 trained giant rats foaming at the mouth
Kill the orcs, Elf lady tells us not to shoot the rats
Elf lady seems to be a druid, she talks to them and they run away
- Orcs have been tracking her for some time
- Asks who we are
- Pulls a sprig of some plant out of her hair, walks around the fire tracing it along the rocks, when complete the fire grows larger
- Reaches into pouch and takes out berries, tosses them into the flames, and the flames turn green
- She speaks in a language we don't know - chants a hymn - breeze picks up and trees shake - "Green man bless" and walks into the trees
- Next saving throw will be automatic success

**Fireseek 18 - Tuesday, morning**
Looking for the elf lady trail - can't find it now

Back to town, bank, replace rations, level up the thief
Planning to go to South Entrance next
