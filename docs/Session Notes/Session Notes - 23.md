**Fireseek 28 Freeday, afternoon**  
in the entryway to the dungeon

Green puddles outside a door to the east
Listening at the door

Get a group of goblins to follow us through this length of dungeon (cost 150gp) - Mork, and 2nd in command Borg

Shrieking mushrooms? Locusts swarming out of the room... Bovril hauling bodies out of the room
___

Beginning combat outside of the room with the locusts - starting over
	Quickly close the doors
	Fight fight fight

Goblins leave us

Headed to treasure room
Emmit disarms one chest with broken war hammer
Another with a saving throw
Another by thief disarming

Proceed to the front entrace
A group of orcs approaches and scouts the door while we look over the battlement
We let them go one turn, they see the light horse and back off
We get out the door and return to town

** Readying 03, Moonday **
Returning to town
