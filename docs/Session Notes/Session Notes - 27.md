**Readying 05 - Waterday**

Just rested in Western Hallway, 3 stone doors, carved in dwarven faces we don't recognize
	hear nothing behind the doors

Open South door
A few hand-sized stones litter the floor, otherwise empty
Dusty with bare walls

Open NE door
Room has a flagstone floor, otherwise empty
Dust covered mural from north corner to eastern wall
Throwing rocks into room did nothing
Poking floor with 10' pole causes floor to rotate, dropping western half into a spike trap
This clears the dust from the wall showing a mural depicting the pit trap

Open NW door
Room is empty
Search for secret doors - NW corner N wall has a faint outline where dust is farther away from wall
Always knocks on door - nothing
Carl spots two holes that are dwarf eye height and two fingers apart - Carl puts his fingers in and the door opens
There are footprints in the dust in the room, heading north, and along the wall are 4 backpacks
	Backpack 1: Thieves' Tools, miniature bell, block & tackle, grappling hook, twine
	Backpack 2: crowbar, chisel, sledge hammer, sword, 6 torches, package of iron rations
	Backpack 3: (2) potions of healing, holy symbol to the green man, bunch of wolfsbane
	Backpack 4: (3) spell scrolls (*floating disc, detect magic, invisibility*), spell book (pocket w/ card inside says "Hamelet Public Library" - *sleep, magic missile, web*)

Go back to statue of Dhurindain to investigate down the NW hallway
Orc war party waiting for us
Retreat down to the secret room, casting ventriloquism into the trap room and throwing a torch in there.  We hear screams, and emerge from the secret room thinking they fell in the trap.  The laughing war party greets us.

Hard battle - defeat the orcs. Another band arrives during the battle. We bar the door and an ogre is battering down the other side.

Loot the bodies and find a potion of growth. Always drinks this and prepares to push the ogre down the hallway to the trap room.
