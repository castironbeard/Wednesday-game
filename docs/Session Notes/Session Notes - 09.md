After the big battle, found on bodies of orcs
	14 cp
	17 gp
	7 pp
	2 deep blue azurites, one better than the other
	Rune stone - circular, smooth, etched, slight blue gem at edge of carvings - spells out "wisdom" - magic item gives +1 wisdom to bearer

Leaders room
shoulder bag under bed
	goblets and gems
seax knife (magical +1)
hexagonal shield, dwarven made, red vertical line, yellow horizontal line, old but pristine - Sagruid picked it up - triggered a constitution save, arm went numb, melded into his arm, can't let go - it is +1, can't be sacrificed to reduce damage but can no longer be crit

Door south of the secret tunnel's west door
sealed portcullis in east wall, manacles line the walls, tables surrounding the walls covered in blood and guts, iron maiden, center of the room has rack and manacles
On the rack is a dwarf, still alive - pick the lock and he starts to slide off the rack, both ankles broken
	grabs Sagruid by the beard - "longbeard, caravan, men at arms, others still here" and falls unconscious
Inside portcullis area - male half elf and large, bald cyclops
Sagruid and Bovril open the portcullis, pull them out to the secret hallway

Dwarf brought back to consciousness
Paladin wasn't able to lay on hands to help the half elf and cyclops

We move slowly through the rooms headed to the exit carrying all of the wounded prisoners

Last room before great hall - two zombies - don't show up in infravision
Killed them - on their foreheads, red mark like dipped in paint/blood, like cursive J

We had to rest and revive Gigglebottoms.  While resting, 4 men in furs and leathers are sneaking through the front doors.  [[NPCs#Valdghar's Vandals]], we met them in the bar.  They have a scrawny retainer with them.  We let them distract the orcs while we slipped out the door.

Escape out the doors around 4pm, push through the night to get back to town with the wounded prisoners.  Arrive right around midnight.

Guards help to move the wounded to the temple. [[Hamelet#Great Forge of Thaneduhr|Great Forge]] [[NPCs#Khalg Hammerhand]] greets us.  We lay the bodies down, he hits a hammer against an anvil calling out the priests.  We leave the bodies overnight.  We learn that the dwarf we rescued is [[NPCs#Gadgrim Longbeard]].
