**Readying 12 - Waterday**
last session
Exploring a new section of the West side of entry hall - ruined forge room and assorted halls
We killed a band of gray goblins and a bugbear

Stone arch to the east depicts dwarves in battle. On the top ledge is a large dwarf holding a hammer in battle stance.

We leave the dungeon, camp with the troops, and come back in the morning.

Continue exploring from the hall where we killed the gray goblins.

Door to the South - open to see an empty room with a rune stone-sized oval, smooth stone in the middle. Poke with 10' pole.
“I, Gergrim Longhelm, etched these runes in remembrance of the life and bravery of my  
friend Thontek.”

Hallway to the west ends in a broken door
Room is filled with furniture, decayed, covered in a white mold. The Southern wall is covered in a green mold in the shape of a door. There is a small key hole.  One of our two keys fit in the hole.  As we turn it, we hear shouting to the East. A band of orcs run past, possibly to the north.

Back to the room. Turn the key to final position, as it clicks, a giant hammer swings down from the ceiling. Knocks Emmit back into a sliding wall which opens over a pit or abyss. Bovril jumps to grab him by the feet.

Investigating secret room. Steel coffer on East side of room. Tables around the wall. On the floor there are 4 or 5 coins leading towards the door. We rest. Check coffer for traps - poison needle on handle. Removed. All pick locks checks fail. Attack it with crowbars - takes 3 turns. We hear orcs run past again.

Opening the chest:
- Huge exquisite green and blue Chrysocolla
- Small exquisite pale blue frost agate
- Med broken lt pink Rhodochrosite
- Very large flawed gray black hematite
- Huge average pale blue quartz
- Med average orange sun stone
- Huge average deep blue azurite

Exit the dungeon - the mercenary camp was overrun by orcs and slaughtered.  We return to town.
