Standing outside the main gate, which is barred by the orcs. The survey team has "Big Bertha", a barrel stuffed with explosives. Will cost 2000gp to use.

The halls seem to be happy for the return of dwarves.  The survey team crawls all over the barracks area we are claiming, evaluating for defense and modification.

We take in a dwarven cleric of Krom (Karl).
