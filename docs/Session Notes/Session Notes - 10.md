[[Hamelet]]

**Fireseek 09 - Godsday, downtime**
Checking on the people we dropped off at the Great Forge (temple).  Dwarvish acolyte takes us to the second floor hospital.  Gruel Hammerhand.  Says [[NPCs#Gadgrim Longbeard]] was working a caravan at his command.  Should be compensated for our trouble.  Word from [[Threshold]] is that [[NPCs#Sir Alec, Champion of St Ygg]] is part of an order there - was also with the caravan.  He's lost his memory.  Athelas is the elf, and wants to leave ASAP.  Cyclopsman's name is Bock, was a mercenary in the caravan, has slipped into a coma.  Rewarded with pouch of coin.

Talking with Athelas - pretty traumatized by the orcs and their treatment of prisoners.  Lots of prisoners killed, he was not because he would make a good slave.  The orcs are getting braver, less afraid of the light.

Wooden table in corner of room - etched into side of table - symbol like an arrowhead pointed downwards with a piece missing from the middle.  Cut in the wood at point.  Looking under the table, a line of text runs from the symbol to the center post and around the central pillar. "He thought he could hide from me, he stuck to highways and stone with a smile on his face. But my arms were strong, strong enough for a mattock."
Base and table top come apart.  In the center of the base is a piece of wood with glyphs etched into it - Elf (Always) feels it could be a spell.  Spell is written in the shape of a hand with seven fingers, starting and ending on the first finger.

Talking with Sir Alec when he wakes up - smiles when he sees us, thanks us for saving him. We introduce ourselves. He plans to return to Threshold after recovering. Always returns his Longsword of St Ygg.

Bag of Coin - 50 gp

sitting in the common room all day, picking up rumors - On a cold night recently there's rumors that a man that was traveling alone. He came into town with two animals as companions that he left to roam around the building. Went into the tavern for the night. People would talk, and he'd just respond with "nothing to say, just waiting out the storm". It was a clear day, so people found this strange. But a blizzard rolled in that night. People asked if his animals would be ok outside, he said they'd be fine. When he left the next day in waist high snow, two bumps followed him through the snow. When he reached the road, people saw they were wolves with white pelts that glowed blue. He was making his way towards Hamelet / Durnagald.

We paid up for 3 nights to rest (36gp total).  2gp for a room with a bunk, 3gp for a solo room, 5sp for a communal room, 5cp to sleep in the stables.  Chose to get bunks for all of us for 3 nights.

Always / Ellinia spent the day studying the 'scroll' - thinks it might take a month to fully translate it, but the word "gaub" in the spell seems to be a name. Gaub's hand? Seems to be a spell that points the way in some sense.

Troy/Sagruid - The cursed shield has grown over his arm and is slowing his healing due to discomfort. Goes to get the shield checked out by Gardul Ironforge. Says the only way he knows to get rid of it is cutting it off. "Beard breakers" is the term - cursed item. The Seer or the Priests might be able to remove it, but it will destroy the shield.

Waiting on south side of the lake for the night to watch for comings and goings

On 3rd watch - coming from the statue in the center of the lake, Emmit sees an orb growing, floating, then moving right. Many more more form. Estimating they are about 3' in diameter.  Some of them approach us - they're small beautiful female forms, clothed in leaves or water plants.  One clearly tries to charm Emmit but he makes his spell save. When this fails, all of them get angry, fly away, launch into the sky and splash back into the lake.
