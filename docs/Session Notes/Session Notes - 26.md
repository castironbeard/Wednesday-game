**Readying 05 - Waterday**

Find phase spider, blind it, fight it, chase it away

Investigating other rooms
Statue room where we met the goblins
	Statue is heavily vandalized by orcs, rubble around it - behind it we find a small finger groove, reveals a small alcove, an object wrapped in burlap, slightly curved dagger, pristine, very sharp
	Door to the NE, alcove to the SE

Alcove - clearly someone has been camping here.  Find a runestone, carved to look like a dwarven face, tucked into the back of the room surrounded by rubble. #runestone

Listen at the northern door - hear nothing
Open the door to an empty chamber
Back wall is covered in yellow lichen
	Elf takes a sample
	We burn the rest

Checking door in northern hallway

Slimes come out under the door with surprise
they splash and burn several weapons and armor, eventually we burn them with torches
Nothing in the room

Searching the rubble as a team - nothing
Searching statue - nothing

nothing found in the statue or the rubble
