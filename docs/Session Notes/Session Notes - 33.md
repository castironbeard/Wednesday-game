**Readying 12 - Waterday**
Exit the dungeon - the mercenary camp was overrun by orcs and slaughtered.  We return to town.

Young dwarf approaches us in town - messenger for Grue Hammerhand - master wishes to see us regarding loss of life

Large gathering of armored dwarves outside the Company of the Axe, all with beards slung over left shoulder (sign of distress).  In the center of the dwarves, we see Thordain Stoneborn, Khalg Hammerhand, Thordack Stoneborn (prince), Finlass Stoneborn (queen), Grul Hammerhand.  Doors to the hall open and they walk in.  Interior is changed - training equipment moved to the edges and covered, center of the hall is a massive stone table. King sits, entourage sits, we sit. Mead is brought out, Khalg blesses.

Khalg - "This is a tragedy. Can't be happening. What gives them the right to warband against us."
Thordack - "Reports came in yesterday - A large force is massing to the East. They can't break the walls but they can choke us out."
Thordain - "We'll take everyone with us into Dwarrowdeep when we retreat there. What are the reports from the entry?"

Dwarves need us to go deeper.
Need to find the city, scout it out. Why are the orcs still there?  Why are they trying to take the surface cities if they have their own?

Grul and Martok may be able to stock the foothold to keep us supplied.
Proposal to charge adventurers to enter the dungeon.  King proposes giving us 15%.  Bruno counters with "and titles / land grants in Hamelet".  King agrees.

Ask about the Hand of Gaub - nobody knows anything. Suggest sending word to Threshold to hire a sage.
