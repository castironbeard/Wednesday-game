**Fireseek 19, morning**
6 hours trek to [[Dwarrowdeep, Ruins of Kaer-Kelek#Doors of Dalgeddin]]

There are tracks, orcs, humanoids, carts
Listened at door, no sounds
Thief tried to sneak in and climb first wall on right - failed and fell
Sneaking along walls and looking in arrow slits - First room on right appears to be remains of a fight, human corpses, look like they were jumped on by something heavy, smells of death and skin is white - corpses bloated

Sneaking along the walls, we find 4 zombies.  Surprise attack, and 2 more zombies come out of the rubble.

We survived, barely, and went back to town to recover.

Note to self - buy oil, more oil, and torches.  And maybe horses.
