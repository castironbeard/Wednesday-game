Session 4
First day of spring
Travel back to Hammlet - arrive around sunset
They let us in the gate, despite the elf
Our quest came from a representative of the king - [[Khalg Hammerhand]], blood of Kaldagian, Hammerhand, Orc Slayer - night Meadhall, daytime ???

Among the three chief priesthoods, there's generally 3 old ones, one of which is High Old One (become the pope), chosen by the All Father.  For reasons unknown there hasn't been a High Old One for a while.  Most view [[Haldgrin Stoneborn]] (blood of ???, high priest of Thanedur) as de facto until one is chosen.

Town
	Human houses and dwarven fortifications
	River on the south side, rest of the town is surrounded by walls
	10 - Large long building - Company of the Axe - Mercenary guild 
	9 - Iron Anvil - blacksmith
	6,7,8,9 - forges - each with a speciality
	8 - Great Forge of Thaneduhr - Temple
	11 - Mead Hall of Geddinthor - beautifully carved, image of Dalgeddin, All Father forging the first dwarf, one large room/hall, fire pits along the walls with tables between, be-gemmed throne at the northern end (king's seat)
	2 - The King's Jewel - money exchange, bank, appraiser
	1 - by western gate - Slovenly Troll - best place to bed down - one of town's oldest structures.  Merchants of Threshold stay here. Wood and thatch, 3 stories. Main room open up all 3 floors. Large fire in center of room. Crowded today.  Algar (owner) is rarely here.
	5 - the Ancient Seer's hut - unnaturally old human, right eye much larger than left, will talk for 50gp and identify magic items for more
	
In the Slovenly Troll
[[NPCs#Lug the Cyclopsman]]
[[NPCs#Jayla the Bar Maid]]
Two Cobblestone siblings (noble dwarf house) apprenticing as servers
[[NPCs#Durass Longbeard]] (noble dwarf house) and his clan members
Hammerhands
Ironforge (noble dwarf house)
5 non-noble dwarves
6 humans (two families, traders)
quite a few adventurers
merchants
table full of cyclops men
[[NPCs#Prince Thordain Stoneborn]] - early middle aged, regal, natural leader - talking to a group of heavily armed individuals
	The prince told us he's been given purview of the reclaiming by his father, but he was uncertain of details. Seemed to be fishing.  The adventurers mocked us.

We book the suite for the night (25gp)

the adventurers went towards the Everwinter Wood (east side of mountains)

Non-dwarves stay at the inn while the dwarves go to the meadhall

Listening at the inn
	4 people at the table next to us (Northerners, from the Ice Plains above the Mountains) - "don't think we'll make it in Durnagald, but we heard that Eadbhert (ealdorman) was looking for the Seat of Sir Rodarick Erminemantle (legendary knight) in the [[Deadwood Mote]] - maybe we wait for these others to clear it out and we go in after".  A one-eyed man in the group - definitely the low man on the totem pole.  Generally going to prop him up, commiserate, make him look better, buy drinks, etc. Getting an ally in the group.  While keeping him busy, George/Roy goes to the party to get info on Deadwood Moat. Roy - "Ghosts in a crypt, just so you know." Back and forth. Not much coming out. 
	One eyed guy (McLoy Giggalbottoms) - wants to be an adventurer, dad took his eye, lived in an orphanage because his parents sucked.  That party is abusing him - going to put him in the front line. Josh/Drukkur attempts to woo him away.
	Jayla - asking about [[Deadwood Mote]]. The fjord/ferry across the river is the fastest way, but that's not open currently (Croag, old ferry man, doesn't like asparagus).  Travel west out of the town and cross the bridge going south, about 1 hour down the road, head east, in the center of the forest is the ruins.  Some of the hunters around town have seen it and want to avoid it.


2 party members went to the Seer's hut
	strong smell of weed, bear and large rodent skull outside door, movement in the firelight inside
	knocked on the door - a pot is dropped, "no one's home"
	rude exchange - Troy/Sagruid trying to determine if the old man is old enough to have been there since he was snapped through time -- Seer wants money (50gp or more)

At the Meadhall
	Thorgallon Stoneborn - king of the Dwarrow
	Thordack Stoneborn - Thordain's son
	Thendlass Stoneborn - Queen of the Dwarrow
	Kolg Hammerhand - Old One, quest giver

[[NPCs#Khalg Hammerhand]] approaches us and asks how the first day went - we give him the full rundown
	Checks an old book on description of the ring, shows us a page
	The Ring of House Longbeard, one of the rings of power granted to the Dwarves by an old friend turned foe.  Six of the rings are lost to the dwarves, the only one remaining is on the hand of the king.
	Gave us a rough map of the entryway (we've covered about 1/10th of it)
	We let him know about the prince - Khalg is good natured about it, says the prince wants to "act above his beard length" and be king before his time.  Don't worry about it.


Rough mapping
	There's an entrance at all four cardinal directions - The main entrance is the Southern one
	There's rumors of 2 more entrances

Head back to the inn after.
