last session
Proceed to the Doors with the retainers and light units from the mercenaries
Leaving light horse and light unit with the supplies
Taking two medium units into the dungeon

[[Dwarrowdeep, Ruins of Kaer-Kelek#Hall of Pillar Statues]] - Heading west through the wide hall, through large archway - large 10' square pillars, 30' tall - dwarven warriors, all defaced but one (northern pillar, to our right).
- The Northern statue is one of Thaneduhr with glistening red glowing eyes - large rubies?
- Statue to the south might have had gems in the eyes previously but they've been chipped out
- SE connects back to the Western entryway, murder holes, and battlements
- S and N are archways to new areas

new
Decide to move south out of the Hall of Pillar Statues
Through the archway a long hallway stretches out and ends in a large stone door (bigger than the dwarven doors we've seen so far)
Door opens into a large octagonal room
Room might have once been a training room and common area - symbol on the floor is House Hammerhand (heads of the mercenary lodge in town, fighting clan of the kingdom)
Doors to the N, NE, and W

Noise coming from the ceiling - There are stirges on the ceiling.  Corpses under them on the floor.
We can see their eyes, they're looking at us.  We maintain eye contact with torches and bows pointed to keep them from thinking we are unaware.

Listening at the N door.  Hear nothing.
Open door.  Hear clicking noise.  Rusty crossbow trap hits Bruno. Then stirges attack.

Checking N room for additional traps
Ellinia is down and needs to rest
Listen at doors for all of octagonal room - nothing
Use 3 torches and camp for night in N room

Starting around Midnight
W door - stone collapsed in hallway - dusty, debris
Step into room, collapse ends near N wall, ceiling is clean, big collapse of stone as we leave

WSW door - small room, decayed bunks, search and find nothing

SW door - partially collapsed room, forge tucked under the rubble in the corner, door in SE corner
Looking towards ceilings, shelf near door, small fabric wrapped item - death save, kills Ellinia, use coin to bring her back
Above the doorframe next to the shelf is a small clockwork cobra
Above the door is a small hole that the clockwork sits in

Door in forge room - Empty room

S door
Door is destroyed with axes, dwarven weapons and armor are strewn around the floor, nothing of value

E door - large hallway with door to north and hall to south - head south
Hear a footstep to the south
Sneak forward and see with infra 8 halfling sized and 1 dwarf sized creature
Ellinia puts them to sleep
They're stranger goblins than we've seen before - stone colored, no eyes, backs hunched, less civilized
Bugbear is more primitive than normal bugbear
All have clubs, shields and slings. Bugbear has a morningstar. All crude, stone like. No emblems of faction.
We kill them all.
One farthest in back has a sack made from a stomach of a large creature with intestines for a strap. Inside we find 
- dwarvish rune stone - dwarvish writing, "Shield", small hole in the top as if meant to be worn on a chain
- 19cp, 22sp, 6ep, 6pp
