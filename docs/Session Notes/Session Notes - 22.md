**Fireseek 28 - Freeday, afternoon**  
in the entryway to the dungeon

Emerging after the turning of the undead

Statue is broken to the point that it is difficult to discern - likely a Dwarven god, based on other areas

Peeking through the door to the NW - Statue to the NW - Mighty Dhurindain, covered in purple plant like object, faint sweet smell in the room
More of a moss than a plant
Doesn't kill us immediately on entering
Door to the NE
[[Question Links#Cripple Moss]] - brings in small creatures, covers them, makes them sleepy, destroys them with acidic secretions

Searching the room after
The ceiling collapses, landing on Bovril (1hp damage)
Checking the statue of Dhurindain
Eye level with the dwarf, hand holding tongs, half a marking on the wall, rotating to make a full image, markings on the tongs together with wall shows a symbol for "unstable construction"

Very slight cart tracks (in the stone) move through this area - in the stone, not in the dust

Green puddles outside a door to the east
Listening at the door

Get a group of goblins to follow us through this length of dungeon

Shrieking mushrooms? Locusts?
