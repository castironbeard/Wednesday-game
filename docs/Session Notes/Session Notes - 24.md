We go to the seer to identify our runes/weapons that we collected 
- 4 leaf clover runestone- grants luck to the holder (+1 on all saving throws) 
- leaf runestone - rejuvenation (benefits to people healing from spells/potions/etc.) 
- runestone with a grindstone on it - seer couldn't read this one, but when we spoke to the clerics they said it increased combat effectiveness and magic effect for +1d4 rounds (7 uses?) 
- mini runestone bag with dwarven runes - sling stones that break open and spread into multiple runestones of war +2 (4 runestones all with +2; aka good shit) 
- *Skullbreaker* - seer only saw images of frost-laden barbarians using it to annihilate yetis (3x damage on a crit, Greathammer that can shrink to a size that Small characters can use)
- quiver + arrows - go further and do more dmg (+10 range, +1 dmg) 

We also purchase some scrolls from the seer: read languages, and light/darkness. 
We also buy the seer's chest in which he holds the scrolls in: as he opened it, Ellinia began to have a migraine as she was able to see the same type of glowing occultist language as she saw under the table that allowed me to learn my road-questioning spell. Ellinia became haunted by nightmares throughout the week we spent healing; i have dreams of people with extra limbs, amalgamations of what used to be just one person, becoming the vessel for multiple arms, legs, heads; all of which seem to have a mind of their own. These nightmares and understanding of the occult language gave me the new spell "Orgiophant," which adds limbs/heads to the creature I cast it on. 

Meanwhile, the rest of the party went to the Stonecutter's guild to gather the dwarves we will be escorting inside the dungeon, as well as 2 medium units. 

As we head out to survey (without purchasing rations or extra torches, lol), the town gives us a nice little parade: cheering us on and chanting us with their dwarvish prayers of victory. 

As we head towards the main entrance of the dungeon feeling good, an orc warband is spotted. They owned a giant bat that we tried to shoot at, but ultimately failed at killing. Eventually, everything fucks off and we end up getting to the main entrance gate just to find that it is locked (most likely because the orc warband found us). 

As we sit there, recalling the geometry of the main entrance door and the lock mechanisms, the dwarves come out from behind with "Big Bertha," a 2k GP bomb(?) that they say can open the door. (Also the dwarves did dwarf-stacking to estimate the dimensions of the new entrance we want to create from the outside)
