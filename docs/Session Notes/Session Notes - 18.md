**Fireseek 22, Starday, afternoon**  Torrential rain
 [[Dwarrowdeep, Ruins of Kaer-Kelek#Doors of Dalgeddin]]

To the south doorway

- bare room, geometric shapes lining the wall (diamonds, dodecahedrons, multi-sided, etched into columns and walls)
- center of the room - Dwarven warriors, 5 bodies in a heap, slain, strewn about as if fallen in combat
- Fossilized skeletons
- Combat starts

We defeat the skeletons by getting them to move through the petrifying statue room.
- Find 6 pristine crossbow bolts on one of them

Using mirror to investigate the face with the emerald eyes
- Mouth opens, "intruder approaches!", eyes start to glow, mirror vibrates in hand, emeralds are large and probably valuable

Moving to the East beyond the petrifying faces
Former training room, broken weapon racks, training dummies, weapon stands, rotting tapestries hanging from the ceiling and piled on the floor, Dwarvish and Orcish weapons scattered on the floor
Floor is dusty
4 large statues (Thaneduhr (South) has been defaced - eyes gouged out and nose broken off, Geldinthur, Durendain, Dalgeddin)

SW room - peering in
- floor is covered in rubble

Next room to the east - broken beds towards the back wall - probably a barracks
- tossing the beds reveals 3 runestones
	- "This stone marks the life of Muldal Blackanvil, master warrior"
	- "Remember the strength of my cousin Thalur Ironforge II who waded into the Orc ranks at the Battle of the Bloody Axes"
	- "I Rothdin wrote the runestone to honour the ancestors of House Barrelhelm"

Next room to the east (Southeast corner) - another barracks full of beds in slightly better shape
- tossing the beds triggers a colony of amber mold to spore up
- Roy suffers terribly
- Find a bag with a
	- silver helm (85gp)
	- gold disc brooch inlaid with garnets (150gp)

Noise from the East hallway
We scamper to the west to hide behind the petrifying faces in the skeleton room - and find giant rats in the skeleton room - decide to move on further west
Toss a torch into the petrifying face area and keep backing west

coin purse in the corner? - 36pp, 6gp, 50sp, 100cp

Wait it out until the orcs, rats, and zombies fight each other to the death, then come in after.  We surprise them while they are looting the fallen.  Only 3 orcs survive - 2 grunts and the warband leader.
- grunts - 62cp, 5gp, 32sp, 5ep, 20gp
- leader - 36sp, 15gp, 18pp, electrum bracelet 100gp, gold scabbard 500gp, +1 light crossbow, runestone - pristine, perfectly smooth, etched into is a 4leaf clover
(need XP from the orcs as well)
