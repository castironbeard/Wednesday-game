**Fireseek 15 - Starday, night**
During 1st watch (Roy)
zappy noises and growls to the East and South
Warp Beast (copyright)

Killed the beast, revived Emmit, rested through the rest of the night

**Fireseek 16 - Sunday, morning**
Skin the beast, get rations for full day for the party
also got the glands that can be used in alchemy

Return to Hamelet around 6pm
Always learns that the spell he's been studying can tell him things about those who have traveled on a road, and that Gob has something to do with 7 fingers and the finger of the imagery is associated with pointing the way
	Bury your hands or feet under the surface of a pathway or road. Then, speak to the path: ask it up to one question per level about those who have trodden upon it.
Go to Martok to ask about displacer cloaks - he doesn't know how to make the cloak but he has a buyer coming in on Fireseek 25
Seer offers us 3000gp for the skin

Speaking to Gurduul Ironforge about the displacer beast skin - might have better luck with Elves to the north, but for the right price he could take a crack - might take a month and 3k gp, some clerics, maybe the seer

Always looks around for someone with 7 fingers and tattoos of rings on their fingers. Some humans in the corner have a tattooed ring finger.

(after going outside the walls for a bit) Roy asks at the bar about speaking to a Cobblestone who was asking about dwarven relics.  Bar owner is confused by this because "that boy hasn't come into his money yet and is arguing about it with his brother - I'd not offer him any relics"

**Fireseek 17 - Moonday, morning**
Torrential rains
Head towards East Entrance
Get there around 3pm and climb the switchbacks
We hear armored footsteps on the platform
Sneaking up, Roy sees a tall creature holding a large metal cudgel, with mushrooms growing off it -- a troll

We flee and escape, then camp in the woods for the night
Elves take watch, Always, Karra, Roy
north facing trees and rocks to the south
First watch - a female scream to the north, 2 or 3 orcish war cries.  Always ignores it and 10 minutes later he hears sticks breaking coming towards us. All wake up, help Emmit into his armor.
A female elf runs past, bloodied from a wound in her shoulder, west to east, top torn, bottoms white furs, decorated with bones, platinum white hair.  She turns to catch her breath and two arrows slam into the tree next to her.  She gasps out "Orcs, six, rats"

We'll open with surprise next week.
