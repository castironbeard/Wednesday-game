Session 8
Interogating captured orc
	Mines to the South - a few guards, mostly slaves of all types
		they mine the ore and take it north further into the mountain
	Maybe 3 orcs in the area north of the doors
	"Shabaz" further to the north - orc is afraid - Shabaz is the "leader" and turns people into "his things"
	Secret door on west wall
		Has 'waymark' on the walls - secret runes that only dwarves can see - right at dwarf height - says "secret" indicating a stone in the center of the far wall.  Entire hallway is lined with perfectly spaced amazingly carven faces of patriarchs.  Always look like they're looking at you, even in infravision.
	Waymarks are all over this region, have helpful guidance like "bridge ahead" or "danger"
	Secret brick - pull out and then push in - short tunnel with secret door on other end
	Opened door and surprised orcs who were waiting to ambush us
	Orcs have dire wolves and winter wolves

Very large battle, attrition, folks fell, two unconscious characters

Loot - 56, 64, 65, 62
