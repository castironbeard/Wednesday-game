Outside the East Entrance - 

in media res - rescuing Sagruid from the bottom of the cliff
Stabilize Sagruid
Head back down the hill to regroup and back up to sneak in
Attack guard orc from behind - we miss, he shouts, Roy kills him
	loot: sapphire

Try to entice the orcs inside to come out piecemeal by holding up the dead orc *Weekend at Bernie's* style.  Defeat 4 and drag the bodies out of the way.
	loot: 3 spears, 3 scimitars, 6gp, 2ep, 5sp, 5cp

Head north into the portcullis room
rat eaten beds, dwarven geometric decorations

Further north we find a prison room mirroring the south
Nobody on the Eastern battlement - rested there
Checking cells - nothing W-E 1, 2, 3 - 4th and 5th room has movement
cell B is an awful smell - CON check
cell D - not a cell - has a bedroom set - is a large orc with rats hanging from his belt - strong smell, he is shirt-cocking it
cell E - 3 giant rats and 4 or 5 big rats (not normal size)
kill orc in cell D - might be a [[rat king]]?

Rat king's room - bed and night stand - whip on nightstand, rotting wolf fur on the floor, scimitar, dagger
	loot: 5gp, 8ep, 9sp, 2cp

This area is odd for stone - it is "foster stone" where the orc was - the mortar is 2cm too shallow
	apply the mining pick or crowbar or hammer
under the ground here is a leather bag
	huge brochian versitite, large transparent green agurlite, small green azurite

room in the middle - beds in the room
	Roy kills them as an assassin
	Loot: 2 shields, shield, scimitar, iron helm
