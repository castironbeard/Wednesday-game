**Readying 05 - Waterday**

We were hiding in the secret room. A band of orcs were waiting of us.

Hard battle - defeat the orcs. Another band arrives during the battle. We bar the door and an ogre is battering down the other side.

Loot the bodies and find a potion of growth. Always drinks this and prepares to push the ogre down the hallway to the trap room.

1st round - shove the ogre back over 4 of the orcs, crushing them
2nd round - shove the ogre into the trap room
Win the battle, loot the bodies, head to the entry to help the dwarves

(Dwarves at the entry - 5 light units, 4 heavy units, 8 archers, + the surveyors, we have 2 heavy units left with us)

Run south into chambers north of the main room. An Orc champion, an ogre, and 3 orcs are there. Thieves sneak attack the champion. Always throws the ogre into the orcs.

We defeat the orc / ogre ambush.  Dwarves gather around us after and chant a "king" chant.  The aspect of the rooms gets lighter and the echoes are stronger than expected.  Head surveyor approaches. We now have a plan for the stronghold. Loot the bodies and head to town.
