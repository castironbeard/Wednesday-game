**Fireseek 22, Starday, afternoon**  Torrential rain
 [[Dwarrowdeep, Ruins of Kaer-Kelek#Doors of Dalgeddin]]

*last session*
Wait it out until the orcs, rats, and zombies fight each other to the death, then come in after.  We surprise them while they are looting the fallen.  Only 3 orcs survive - 2 grunts and the warband leader. We kill them and loot the room.

(need XP from the orcs as well)

---
Arrive back at the doors, the mules are gone, the rope is cut, and there's blood in the area. The ranger (Karra) tries to track the mules/creatures that took them.

Go back to the statue room to investigate other rooms.

NW room - empty, closed door in W wall, archway in NE corner, table in SW corner of room, rotting beds. Rotting tapestries hanging from the 25' ceiling in purple and gold, hard to make out the design.
NE archway leads to this is a large hall, bare stone, hallway continues east and north.

NW door is a large stone door with a keyhole - and trapped.  Trap removed. Lock picked.
Wall directly in front of us has the face of Thaneduhr etched into the wall. Room is pristine, untouched. 5 beds, only touched by dust. Fire pit in the center of the room.  Metal rod on the side of the firepit for hanging food over the pit.
Archway in SW corner - blocked by portcullis
	inside the portcullis is a room filled with chests of gold and gems - the officers' tithe
	No opening mechanism
	Searching with dwarven construction tricks finds a hole next to the door, looking through sees a 2 next to symbol like a bar
	Emmit grabs the second bar and tries to move it - it goes up, creating an opening

No detectable traps, but touching a chest causes one of Bovril's fingers to fall off

Dissipate the curse on two chests:
- 900gp, deep blue azurite, bloodstone, black sapphire
- 800gp, 700sp, 1000cp, 300pp, tiger eye, bloodstone, rainbow obsidian, purple amethyst, green aquamarine

We rest in this room for the night. Gigglebottoms tells us a baudy tale from the orphanage. Ellinia and Karra are completely drawn into the bard's spell briefly.

During first watch (Always) hears something at the door. Wakes up Karra. Listening.
	Creature on the other side. Door handle being moved. Fingers reaching under and finding the spikes. A nose snuffling along the door. Whatever it was is interrupted by dwarvish speaking folk, which we overhear it eating. Blood starts seeping under the cloaks we stuffed under the door.

**Fireseek 23, morning**  
The scene in the room is grotesque. Creature footprints go north.

We skedaddle. There's a cart in the entryway. Nothing hitched to it, but 16 bodies (zombies we recently killed, etc) are piled inside. All have the white mark on the forehead that we saw in the Eastern gate. We light the cart on fire and leave.

We brought back 7924gp (partly jewelry etc)
